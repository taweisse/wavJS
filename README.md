# WAV.js - JavaScript WAV Generation & Playback Library

`WAV.js` is a small JavaScript library for constructing & playing back PCM WAV files right inside the browser. It is certainly not the first library of its kind, nor is it as fully featured as many alternatives.  

*Why develop it then?*

Discounting my own stubbornness, many projects do not need all of the features that come with a heavyweight audio library. They simply need to generate and play sound from audio samples. This is exactly what `WAV.js` aims to accomplish, and nothing more. The API is very straightforward and has only a few exposed methods. WAV files are limited by up to 2 16-bit channels at a maximum of 96000 samples per second.
